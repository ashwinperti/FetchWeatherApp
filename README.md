# FetchWeatherApp
Created as part of Getting Started With Android: Part -I and Part -II, this Android app involves use of latest Android design and functionality
by employing Material Design and content_main.xml layout to create a seamless yet simplistic Weather App that pulls data via API Key from
openweathermap.org and displays it in a Scrollable List View.

### Open Weather Map API Key is required

An API keymust be included with the build, which can be obtained from openweathermap.org and inserting it in the app/build.gradle file by 
replacing FetchWeatherMapApiKey constant with the Key.
